The proposed medical hospital bot is an innovative AI-driven solution designed to enhance patient engagement and streamline healthcare processes. Accessible via a hospital's website or mobile app, the bot offers a range of functionalities, including user onboarding to collect essential information, a symptom checker that utilizes Natural Language Processing to provide preliminary health advice, and a specialty database for doctor recommendations based on assessed symptoms.
Additionally, the bot facilitates appointment scheduling by checking real-time availability and integrating with the hospital's management system for seamless booking. It also supports payment processing and sends reminders to ensure patients stay informed about their appointments. With a focus on data management and security, this bot aims to improve patient experiences while optimizing operational efficiency within healthcare facilities, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.
